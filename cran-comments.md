## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version:

- I used the CRAN template for the License.
- In the description, I added an explanation of Presto and provided the
  link to its website.

# Test environments

- OS X 10.10.5 Yosemite, R 3.1.2 and 3.2.4
- CentOS 6.7, R 3.2.2
- win-builder (devel and release)
- WinXP, R 3.2.4

# R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

- The 'note' is about first time submission and the LICENSE file which is the BSD 3-clause license.
- win-builder also points out that the 'DBI' word in the Description might have been mis-spelled but the usage is intentional.
